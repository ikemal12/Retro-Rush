## How to play

Simply clone the repo and import it as a project into Godot.  
Note: this project was developed using Godot 3 which was the latest version of the Godot engine at the time.   
However, the engine has transitioned to a new version, therefore the project may not build exactly as it was before.  
For the best experience, I recommend building the game in Godot v3.5.1. If this version is not available, the latest support version v3.5.3 should work as well.
