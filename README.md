# Retro Rush

## Description

A 2D top-down shooter inspired by the retro gaming era, developed using the Godot game engine. 

## How to play

Simply clone the repo and import it as a project into Godot. Note: this project was developed using Godot 3 which was the latest version of the Godot engine at the time. 
However, the engine has transitioned to a new version, Godot 4, therefore the project may not build exactly as it was before.
